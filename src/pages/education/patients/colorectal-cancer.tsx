              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Colorectal cancer is a common and potentially life-threatening disease that begins in the colon or rectum.
                It typically develops slowly over several years and often starts as non-cancerous polyps. 
                Detecting and removing these polyps early can prevent the development of cancer.
              </p>

              <h2>Symptoms</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Persistent changes in bowel habits</li>
                <li>Rectal bleeding or blood in stool</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain or cramps</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>Fatigue or weakness</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Age over 50</li>
                <li>Family history of colorectal cancer</li>
                <li>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</li>
                <li>Low-fiber, high-fat diet</li>
                <li>Smoking and heavy alcohol use</li>
                <li>Sedentary lifestyle</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Prevention</h2>
              <p>
                Preventive strategies include regular screening (such as stool tests, colonoscopy, or blood-based screening),
                a healthy high-fiber diet, regular physical activity, avoiding tobacco, and limiting alcohol intake.
              </p>

              <h2>Importance of Early Detection</h2>
              <p>
                When detected early, colorectal cancer is highly treatable and often curable.
                Routine screening helps identify cancer at an earlier stage — or even before it develops —
                significantly improving treatment outcomes and survival rates.
              </p>

              <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
              <p>
                Treatment depends on the cancer's stage and location. Options may include surgery to remove tumors,
                chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapies. Early-stage cancers may be resolved with
                less invasive procedures and fewer long-term complications.
              </p>
